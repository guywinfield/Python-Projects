# A Chess Question
Given a chessboard state that the user enters, with 1 white figure and up to 16 black figures, the code returns which black figures the white figure can take. This can either be done manually or randomly when prompted by the script with the helps of prompts, exceptions and printed board visualisations.

## Description
Following the guidance from the project requirements (https://intra.turingcollege.com/hardskills/a-chess-question). This code individually unit tests each function from the mini-tasks (see next cell), all mandatory and optional mini tasks have been completed.

In addition to the mini-tasks 2 additional functions were created to fulfill the following:
- Implement a Nice Visualization Function: def print_chessboard()
- Implement Starting Position Generation: def random_start()

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Installing the tabulate library is a pre-requisite for chessboard visualisations
```
pip install tabulate
```


### Executing program

* The code in the file is written in a linear way. You need to run all cells starting from top to bottom in order to successfully run the script.


## Help

This script was built and run using Google Collab. If there is any issue running locally it may be either your Python interpreter isn't installed or jupyter notebooks hasn't been hosted. There are pip installs used occasionally in this script which could also lead to errors.
