# Project description

### Project Goal

The first practical graded task will require you to implement a Python program which will answer a simple question – given a board state that the user enters, with 1 white figure and up to 16 black figures, which black figures can the white figure take? 

### How to get started with Google Colab to make the project:

- Visit the [Colab page](https://colab.research.google.com/)

- Log in with your private Google Account or create one.

- After downloading the file from this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nCV0xJCbXx95gLQrtbv4jE6GLPqYzOL6?usp=sharing)),

- Start by adhering to the instructions in the file, while considering the criteria below for a broader perspective on the project requirements.

> If you wish and feel more comfortable, you can use an IDE of your choice to complete the project separately from the Jupyter Notebook provided above.


# Task Requirments
### **1.User Input for White Piece**
- The program must prompt the user to input a white piece and its position on the board.
- The user must choose between two predefined piece types (e.g., pawn and rook).
- The input format must be: <piece> <location> (e.g., knight a5).
- The program must confirm a successful addition or display an error message if the input is invalid.
---
### **2.User Input for Black Pieces**
- After the white piece is set, the user must input black pieces, one by one.
- Each black piece must follow the same format: <piece> <location> (e.g., bishop d6).
- The user must add at least one and at most sixteen black pieces.
- The user can enter "done" to stop adding black pieces only after at least one black piece has been added.
- The program must confirm a successful addition or display an error message if the input is invalid.
---
### **3.Input Validation**
- The program must ensure that input coordinates follow the correct format (<letter><digit>, where letter is a-h and digit is 1-8, e.g., a1, d4, h8).
- The program must handle edge cases, such as:
- Attempting to enter "done" before adding at least one black piece.
- Providing invalid chess piece names.
- Entering out-of-bounds coordinates.
---
### **4.Output and Gameplay Logic**
- After all pieces are added, the program must display a list of black pieces that the white piece can capture based on valid chess moves.
- If no black pieces are capturable, the program should indicate this clearly.



# Optional Tasks

After the main functionality is implemented, your code works correctly, and you feel that you want to upgrade your project, choose one or more improvements from this list. Again, this is strictly optional. **Some of these optional tasks may be challenging.**


### **1. Implement a Nice Visualization Function**
- Create a function to print the chessboard using Unicode chess symbols to accurately represent each piece.
- Ensure proper alignment of pieces in an 8x8 grid, with row and column labels.
---

### **2. Implement Danger Squares Visualization**
- Create a function that highlights all squares that the white piece can attack, even if the path is blocked by another piece.
- Use ASCII symbol of X or color coding to mark dangerous squares
---

### **3. Implement Starting Position Generation**
- Modify your code so that in the beginning, the program will ask you your preference. Would you like to enter the figures manually or generate them randomly? If the user selects random generation, implement functions that would place one white figure and sixteen random black ones.
---

### **4. Implement a Game Menu System**
- Replace the linear input system with an interactive menu that allows flexible commands.
- Menu Options:
Commands:
```
  - white_input <piece> <location>    (e.g., knight a5)
  - black_input <piece> <location>    (e.g., bishop d6)
  - print_board                       (displays the current board)
  - check_captures                    (lists capturable black pieces)
  - exit                              (quits the program)
```
---
### **5. Implement a Capture Minigame**
Goal: Allow the white piece to capture a selected black piece, then check if further captures are possible.
How it Works:
```
  1.  The player selects a white piece.
  2.  The program highlights capturable black pieces.
  3.  The player selects which piece to capture.
  4.  The captured piece is removed, and the game updates the board.
  5.  The player can look for new captures and repeat.
```
Extra Challenge:
Create preset scenarios where players must capture all black pieces in the correct order.
Example scenario:
```
  - White piece rook e4
  - Black pieces pawn h4, pawn h8, pawn e8, pawn a8, pawn a1
  - From the given position, the rook can take either e8 or h4, but only one would ensure sequential clearance of the board
  - Correct capture sequence would be h4->h8->e8->a8->a1
```

> Also, Remember the [20-minute rule](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/537395978/How+to+learn+at+Turing+College#Asking-for-help): If you get stuck for 20+ minutes on a single exercise, take a break and join an **Open Session** designated to Python or check with your peers. It is okay if you cannot solve these challenges yet on your own.

Finally, if you don’t know chess, keep in mind that to solve problems at work as a data analyst, you will always need to learn more about the industry in which you are working. For example, if you start working as a data analyst for a logistics company, you will benefit greatly from gaining a good understanding of how logistics work.

### (Optional) Additional Resources


Here are some helpful resources that you could read to better understand how to work with Google Colab:

- [Google Colab Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYoEyIHL6A&t=7s&pp=ygUidHV0b3JpYWwgd29ya2luZyBvbiBnb29nbGUgY29kZWxhYg%3D%3D)
- [Google Colab Official Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16pBJQePbqkz3QFV54L4NIkOn1kwpuRrj)


### Sample questions for a reviewer to ask (a reviewer is encouraged and expected to think of more, however!)

- How do you define a function in Python? How can you easily test whether something is a function in Python? How do you define parameters of a function? How are values passed into funtion?
- What is the difference between a list and a dictionary?
- What is pseudocode?
- Can you show how you debug the program that you have written? Could you make a small change in the code and explain what it will do?

### Project evaluation criteria
